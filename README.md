A comprehensive dashboard for tracking sustainability initiatives across Indonesia, aligned with the Indonesia Gold 2045 Vision.

## Features
This portfolio showcases my work at the intersection of policy analysis, local development, and sustainability. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative research methods, I analyze how public policies-especially those implemented at the grassroots level-can drive sustainable economic and social transformation. My research is grounded in the latest frameworks from international development, environmental economics, and public-private partnerships, with a particular focus on Indonesia and similar emerging economies.
Through a series of interactive dashboards, policy briefs, and data visualizations, I map the impact of local interventions to global sustainability goals (SDGs), ESG metrics, and international best practices. Each project is informed by rigorous academic research and aims to bridge the gap between policy design, community engagement, and scalable impact. My approach is interdisciplinary, combining insights from public administration, development economics, and environmental science to deliver actionable recommendations for stakeholders in government, civil society, and the private sector.

## Key Insight: Strategic Review of the `economics_lit` Repository

This repository presents the Indonesia Sustainability Audit Dashboard—a scientifically rigorous framework for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing sustainability initiatives across Indonesia, tightly aligned with the Indonesia Gold 2045 Vision. Leveraging a blend of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, the dashboard offers actionable policy analysis at both national and grassroots levels, grounded in contemporary international development, environmental economics, and public-private partnership frameworks.

### Scientific and Technical Foundations 
- Integrates robust academic literature, including empirical studies on decentralized governance, ESG metrics, SDG alignment, and grassroots innovation.
- Employs advanced data processing (pandas, plotly, streamlit) to deliver detailed metrics, theme distribution analyses, and ESG/SDG mapping.
- Technical implementation features modular filtering (region, theme, ESG, GRI, IFC), interactive charts, and dynamic reporting to support reproducibility and transparency.

### Strategic and Policy Value 
- Enables policy stakeholders to evaluate sustainability programs' effectiveness, risks, and performance using key indicators and standards (ESG, SDGs, GRI, IFC).
- Bridges gaps among policy design, implementation, and impact measurement, fostering evidence-based decision-making for government, civil society, and private sector actors.
- Offers nationwide and region-specific insights, facilitating inclusive development and strategic resource allocation.

### Readability and Accessibility 
- The dashboard is user-friendly, with clear visualizations, concise insights, and a readable interface.
- Documentation provides context, installation/use instructions, and links to key academic references for further study.
