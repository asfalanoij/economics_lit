# Indonesia Sustainability Audit Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard for tracking sustainability initiatives across Indonesia, aligned with the Indonesia Gold 2045 Vision.

## Features
This portfolio showcases my work at the intersection of policy analysis, local development, and sustainability. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative research methods, I analyze how public policies-especially those implemented at the grassroots level-can drive sustainable economic and social transformation. My research is grounded in the latest frameworks from international development, environmental economics, and public-private partnerships, with a particular focus on Indonesia and similar emerging economies.
Through a series of interactive dashboards, policy briefs, and data visualizations, I map the impact of local interventions to global sustainability goals (SDGs), ESG metrics, and international best practices. Each project is informed by rigorous academic research and aims to bridge the gap between policy design, community engagement, and scalable impact. My approach is interdisciplinary, combining insights from public administration, development economics, and environmental science to deliver actionable recommendations for stakeholders in government, civil society, and the private sector.
